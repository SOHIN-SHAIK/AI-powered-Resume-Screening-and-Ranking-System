## ⚙️ Ranking Algorithm Overview

* **Text Extraction:** Extract resume text using PyPDF2
* **Vectorization:** Use TF-IDF to vectorize job descriptions and resumes
* **Similarity Calculation:** Compute cosine similarity between vectors
* **Ranking:** Sort resumes by highest similarity to the job description

---

## 📋 Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Libraries: `streamlit`, `PyPDF2`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`
  Install via:

```bash
pip install streamlit PyPDF2 scikit-learn pandas
```

---

## 📊 Example Output

| Resume      | Similarity Score |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| resume1.pdf | 0.85             |
| resume2.pdf | 0.79             |
| resume3.pdf | 0.65             |
